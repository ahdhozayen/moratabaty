This file is a dummy file, that doesn't contain any important data
The reason for the existence of this file is to keep the containing directory tracked under the git repo
The containing directory is always empty, because it is just a place to receive temporary generated payslips
that get's deleted directly after sending them
And because it is empty, it will not be tracked by the git repo, unless it contains any files.
